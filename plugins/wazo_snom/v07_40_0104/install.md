## Handset authentication code

In order for the handsets to associate with the DECT base station, it is necessary to enter a PIN in
the register menu on the handset. The authentication code for a device in autoprov mode is `0000`.
For all subsequent handsets, the code is the last four digits of the line position (e.g. if you
have the line at position 1, the code will be `0001`).
